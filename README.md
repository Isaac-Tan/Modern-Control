# Application of Modern Control to Dynamic Maglev System 

## Abstract
The purpose of this report is to investigate a dynamic maglev system and develop a complete output-feedback controller that drives the system to a set of desired equilibrium points. The report outlines how the system is modelled, linearised and controlled. The impact of LQR controllers is discussed and how adjusting the weight of constants effects the rest of the system. It also covers how a controller that was initially designed to regulate state-feedback was adapted to work in black-box environments where states are required to be estimated and adjusted according to error. The implementation of the optimised controller is then tested with different initial conditions over different time periods to test the robustness and validity of outputs. 

A report outlining the entire project can be seen in _Final Report.pdf_.
